This project involved replicating the main functionalities of kbin.social over three sprints. In the first phase, the platform was cloned using Django (MVC server-side framework) and PostgreSQL (separate database architecture) to create a classic web app. In the second phase, a Level 2 REST API was designed and implemented in Python, complete with Swagger documentation. The final phase involved developing a responsive client web application using the React.js framework.
